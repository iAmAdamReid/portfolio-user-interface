#User Interface

The "S&J Architects" website is a mock website built for a fictional construction company according to a set of given design specs. The objective was to build a mobile-responsive static website using HTML, JS, and the LESS CSS preprocessor.

The website is responsive to mobile widths breaking at 600px, and uses a combination of JavaScript and GreenSock animations in order to accomplish the menu overlay, the services menu, and the projects carousel.

Built during User Interface Project Week at Lambda School by Adam Reid.

A live demonstration of the website hosted on Netlify can be found [here](https://adam-reid-ui.netlify.com/).
