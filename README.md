# User Interface Project
## S&J Architects
### HTML, LESS CSS, JavaScript, GreenSock

The "S&J Architects" website is a mock website built for a fictional architecture and construction company according to a set of given [design specs](https://github.com/iAmAdamReid/portfolio-user-interface/tree/master/DesignFiles). The objective was to build a mobile-responsive static website using HTML, JS, and the LESS CSS preprocessor.

The website is responsive to mobile widths breaking at 600px, and uses a combination of JavaScript and [GreenSock](https://www.greensock.com) animations in order to implement the navigation menu overlay, the services menu, and the projects carousel.

Built during User Interface Project Week at Lambda School by Adam Reid.

A live demonstration of the website hosted on Netlify can be found [here](https://adam-reid-ui.netlify.com/).
